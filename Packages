Description: Restore your original /etc/hosts file
 Hosts Cleaner is a script that resets your /etc/hosts file to its original state (default localhost entries).
 .
 Bear in mind this package will remove all non-original Apple hosts entries (ocsp.apple.com is one of them).
 .
 It is advised to install this package before installing 'Untrusted Hosts Blocker' to make sure your hosts file is clean and that other ad blocker tweaks won't interfere with it. This tweak can also help people who may have a corrupted or heavy hosts file (noticable device behaviors: connection issues or slow device).
 .
 You can also install this package to clean your /etc/hosts file. But if you have ad blockers installed such as 'Untrusted Hosts Blocker', you will simply have to reinstall them to add the blocked host entries back to your /etc/hosts file.
 .
 When installed: This package creates a backup of your current /etc/hosts file in /etc/hosts.thireus.hostscleaner.bak.
 When uninstalled: This package only removes the backup file, understand that it will not restore your previous /etc/hosts. If you want to restore your previous /etc/hosts, do it manually with the backup file before uninstalling this package.
 .

Description: Say goodbye to tracking, spies, intrusive ads and untrusted hosts.
 Blocks around 3,000 blacklisted hosts!
 .
 This tweak's main goal is to block a maximum of third-party hosts used by your applications that have been identified as collecting personal and confidential data (location, contacts, UDID, etc.) for commercial, tracking or advertising purpose.
 .
 This package will add all blacklisted hosts to your /etc/hosts file. It will NOT overwrite your custom hosts file (if you already have custom entries in your hosts file, they will remain untouched)!
 .
 If you are unhappy with this hack you can uninstall this package. It will ONLY remove the installed entries by the tweak and leave untouched any other entries you may have added manually to the hosts file. But make sure to wait until the end of the uninstallation process. In case your hosts file is broken (should never happen), the installation or uninstallation script will repair it.
 .
 If Internet is not working on your device anymore after installing this tweak, it means your /etc/hosts file is too big for mDNSResponder. If that happens, please uninstall this tweak, then install "Hosts Cleaner" and reinstall this tweak.
 .
 Avoid combining this tweak with other hosts blocker tweaks as they may interfere with your customized /etc/hosts file.
 .
 IMPORTANT: Due to /etc/hosts filesize limitations since iOS 9, this version mainly focuses on blocking hosts that can impact your privacy or security. Some of the most common advertisement hosts are still blocked by this version but a lot had to be removed from the previous UHB versions. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that you won't see any ads at all. If you are looking to block ads you should install the package "Experimental Untrusted Hosts Blocker" which includes additional hosts such as all the hosts present from "Minimal Hosts Blocker" made by @ReddestDream.
 .
 Please only send me blocking requests for intrusive hosts. I will no longer consider requests for harmless advertisement hosts. Sorry.
 .
 UPDATED: v1.3.0 (30/03/2018) - Official support for iOS 11.
 UPDATED: v1.4.0 (24/07/2018) - The new install script will try to prevent installations that would lead to a /etc/hosts file size that iOS can’t handle (install will fail if the size limit is reached and will ask the user to clear the hosts file). For reference, this is a known issue that break iOS domain name resolving once the hosts file reaches a certain size.
